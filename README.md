# hello-world

Hello, my name is Khang. I'm an aspiring scientist who wants to learn more about computer programming. It's such an important skill to have that I had neglected for so long.  

Specifically I want to master R and Python. My goal is to learn how to use Machine Learning and apply it into my field in Environmental Science.
